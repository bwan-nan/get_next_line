get_next_line
========
### 42 - Project #1

get_next_line is a project that reads the next line on a file descriptor. It basically reads a file line by line.<br />

This project was designed to make us use our brand new [personal library](https://github.com/bwan-nan/libft) but also to get better at C.

### How does it work?

Just run these commands:

    clang -Wall -Werror -Wextra get_next_line.c main.c -L libft/ -lft -o GNL
    ./GNL auteur
 
It should display:

    bwan-nan
